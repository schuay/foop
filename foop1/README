Fortgeschrittene objektorientierte Programmierung
TU Wien, SS 2013
=================================================

Requirements
------------

You will need a couple of programs in order to work on this assignment:

* Qt 4, a somewhat current version is recommended (4.8.4 is the most recent
  one)
* QJson
* CMake
* git
* astyle 2 or higher

If you're looking for a good IDE, QtCreator is the best choice.

Setup
-----

After cloning the git repository, run the following command from the repository
root:

    cp misc/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit

Do not forget about this step! It will help ensure we all use the same coding
style and prevent headaches for all of us.
