For this task we will use:

Squeak VM: http://squeakvm.org/
Squeak 4.1: http://ftp.squeak.org/4.1/Squeak4.1.zip

Extract Squeak4.1.zip into a folder, and then start squeakvm with an
argument pointing to the extracted .image file.

The monticello/ folder is a folder monticello repository. It can be added to
monticello by clicking on '+Repository'. We need to take care not to make
concurrent changes to this repo; ensure you always have the latest version of
the monticello repository before adding new changesets, and don't leave changes
on your disc without pushing them.
